# accumulation

this started from me wanting to learn how to make a simple animation in blender. fast forward 18 months, and my interests have evolved dramatically. after realizing i am trying to write a new loss function and neural network, that somehow mirrors my own cognitive process, i figured it was time to share some of it.  my only goal, is that others can learn and benefit from some of this, as much as i have, in every aspect of my life.    


this is a collection of a bunch of stuff i constantly collect to teach myself things.  i kind of hate the current state of the internet, i always hated school, and that compounds over into the real world, so my goal here is only to teach myself, and hopefully someone else can learn from it too.  if you have anything to add, please feel free to submit something.  havent done any of that but ill figure it out eventually.  


each folder will contain some stuff thats based on the name of directory, probably, maybe. we will see where it goes. lots of jupyter notebooks. i will add some directions for installing the correct env and whatnot for those that are not familiar.  this also exists because every other social media network no longer allows you to post links from any external websites.  thank you monetization, you can get fucked.
